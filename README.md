# 3D Pathfinder

https://3d-pathfinder.glitch.me/

Visualization of A* search algorithm adapted to 3-dimensional space. Search algorithm utilizes binary heap, maze generator utilizes disjoint set.  
Optimized to be mobile device compatible.

## Potential updates

- orthogonal jump point search
- bi-directional search 
- weighted nodes
